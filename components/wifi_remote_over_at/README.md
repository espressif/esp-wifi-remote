# AT based implementation of Wi-Fi remote APIs

:warning: This component should be only used with `esp_wifi_remote`

This component has no public API, it only provides alternative (strong) definitions of `esp_wifi_remote` functions.

It uses `esp_modem` as a host implementation, and `esp-at` at the communication coprocessor side.
